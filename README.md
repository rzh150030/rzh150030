### About me
A software developer who's passionate about finding the best solutions to problems. Starting off as a pre-med student I took some CS college courses in order hone my programming skills that started in high school hoping to increasing my problem solving abilities. In the end, I decided to change career path and go down the software engineering path. Thanks to my inclination towards analyzing and breaking down problems, I found programming to be a good fit for me. I have experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python along with some frameworks such as Express, React, Redux, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. I have built 4 fullstack web applications in my time which are on Github.
